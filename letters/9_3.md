Hi everyone!

I hope you are all excited about To Remember and Forget: Machine and Memory class which is starting next Monday. 
 
Check out updated class syllabus is in this [repository](https://github.com/tchoi8/RememberAndForget). Lecture and reading material will be updated there throughout the class. 

For the first class, please read Freud's 'Notes on the mystic writing pad', which you can find here. 

I will provide digital or print copy of most readings. If you want to purchase a book or two to keep, consider [Synaptic Self](http://www.amazon.com/Synaptic-Self-How-Brains-Become/dp/0142001783) by Joseph LeDoux, which is a great introduction to neuroscience and memory. You can also check out his laboratory's [website](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/overview.htm) for research papers and lectures. [In Search of Memory](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Memory-Emergence-Science-Mind/dp/0393329372/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1409765923&sr=1-4) by Eric Kandel is an engaging autobiography and personal history of neuroscience, which serves as a nice complement to Synaptic Self. 

If you want to watch a film over the weekend, consider [Boyhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys-mbHXyWX4) which is an interesting exercise on time. 

For those who are on the waiting list, please come to the first class and talk to me afterwords. We should be able to figure something out.   
  
Take cares and see you soon!

Taeyoon
