Dear class

Hope you are doing well! 

Here is the [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/tchoi8/to-remember-and-forget-lecture-5) from lecture 5. Hyperlinks on the slides don't work on the browser, please download them to use the links.  
Also, I've been archiving drawings and notes for the class [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/80913365@N04/sets/72157647836748252/). Feel free to use and appropriate them.

Next week I will talk about digital memory in relation to cybernetics and information theory. Second half of the class will be hands on workshop to create digital memory with transistors and logic gate. Please bring your breadboard, tweezer, wire cutter, wire, jumper wire, 5V battery pack and 3 AA batteries. I will bring other parts necessary for the workshop. Let me know if you need help with material and tools, I have few extras. 

**Readings** 

The readings for next week are all optional. They are very important text in the history of computation and digital media but they are quiet dense and dated. I will find few light weight articles and related video clips for you by early next week as well. 


* Claude Shannon, A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits, 1936  
* Claude Shannon, A mathematical theory of communication, 1948 
* Nobert Weiner, Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, 1948  
* Nobert Weiner, The human use of human beings, 1950  
* Manuel DeLanda, War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, 1991 

**Homework**

Please write a short posting about your “Forgetting machine” project and send link to your archiving system(or blog) to me by October 16th.  

Also as I mentioned, Aram Bartholl's [talk at SFPC](blog.sfpc.io/post/98470857551/visiting-artist-aram-bartholl) is tomorrow evening. Let me know if you want to come.
