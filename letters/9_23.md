Comments on your presentation will be updated [here](https://hackpad.com/To-remember-and-forget-Presentation-comments-POhCplfgSxJ) this week. I'm also asking Ishac to leave comments and references.  I thought your ideas and projects were very promising and exciting. I wish everyone continues to work on their project throughout the semester.
