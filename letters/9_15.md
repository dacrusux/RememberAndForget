Dear class.

It was nice to see you all. Here's the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/tchoi8/to-remember-and-forget-lecture-2) and [notes](https://hackpad.com/To-remember-and-forget-lecture-2-uUx5Yc2UZVi).  

Please send me URL or snapshot of your archiving system with brief description if necessary. 

Next week, you will present your first assignment. Each presentation will be limited to 4 minutes.    

I'll be around ITP this Friday between 3~6pm for office hours. Let me know if you'd like to talk about your project, and also if other time works better. 
 
On next week's lecture, we will continue with synaptic plasticity and talk about love :)

this is (kind of not really) related, but if you like AV synthesizer, here's a great (free) [workshop](http://woodshop.github.io/) and performance opportunity in New Hampshire this October. They want to do brain-media mapping as well. If you are interested, register ASAP- it's first come first serve.
